MAJOR CHANGES in RevisionMachine 0.7.0
   * Fixed Issue 46. Removed problematic BINARY_MODE in SQLDatabaseWriter.
   * Fixed problem in ConfigGUI: Configuration in SQL mode was wrong - host property contained db name
   * Added new assembly exectutions to each module
   * IndexGenerator now reads configuration file from any given location - not only from the classpath
   * Fixed problems handling null values for ContributorIds
   * Fixed problem with DiffTool configurations that are not providing a namespace filter setting.
   * Added methods to obtain userContributionMaps (UserName - Timestamp) with user group filtering.
   * Changed contributorId from String to Integer.
   * Added methods for accessing user group assignment data.
   * Fixed Issue 29
   * Diabling keys before inserting values generated by IndexGenerator and re-enabling the keys after inserting has finished.
   * IndexGenerator now automatically adds an index on revisions(ArticleID) 
   * Fixed Issue 22 "Make IndexGenerator runnable from command line"
   * Provided sample config for IndexGenerator
   * Added namespaces 0 and 1 to default configuration upon DiffTool ConfigGUI startup
   * Config GUI tool was extended with filtering functionality
   * Store values that are allowed to be NULL as NULL not as the String "null". 
   * Fixed missing quote arround ContributorName in SQL statement.
   * ArticleFilter can now be configured using namespaces. Prefixes for each namespace are read directly from the xml dump to allow filtering in every language version.
   * Substantial cleanup. Got rid of many many classes that were necessary for the deprecated multi threaded mode.
   * Fixed problems in contributor meta data parsing.
   * Fixed bug in WikipediaXMLReader that was introduced when adding the userid information. Parsing of contributor data is now done in a separate method.
   * Fixed Issue 38: Changes in revision meta data
	   * Instead of storing the contributor name in the field ContributorID, the RevisionMachine now stores the contributor name as "ContributorName" and the contributor id as "ContributorId" in the revisions table.
	   * This make it possible to use the user_groups data available for download from the Wikimedia download pages. 
	   * NOTE: This change makes old databases incompatible with the RevisionAPI. Old databases have to be altered (rename revisions.ContributorID to revisions.ContributorName; create new column revisions.ContributorId)
   * Added a method to retrieve a Map for a given pageId that contains all authors mapped to the timestamps of their contributions.

   * Fixed Issue 20: http://code.google.com/p/jwpl/issues/detail?id=20
	   * Minor flag is now correctly represented in the SQL dump created bye the DiffTool.
	   * Error was in DiffCalculator - wrong parameter was passed on from the revision object to the diff object.
	   * Buffer is now reset after reading the <minor /> flag in WikipediaXMLReader.
   * Fixed compile warnings in RevisionMachine
   * Refactoring
   * Changed dependency from ant:ant to org.apache.ant:ant
